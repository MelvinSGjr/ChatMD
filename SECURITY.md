# Security Policy

Hey, I'm MelvinSGjr. Thanks for caring about security!

## Supported Versions
This is a learning project. All versions are supported for reporting issues, but there are **no security guarantees**.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| latest  | ✅        |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you find a security issue, please open an issue on GitHub or contact me directly via my GitHub profile: [MelvinSGjr](https://github.com/MelvinSGjr).

## Important Notes
- **No encryption:** All messages are sent in plain text. Anyone on the network can read them.
- **No authentication:** Anyone can join your server if they know the IP and port.
- **No protection against MITM:** Man-in-the-middle attacks are possible. Don't use this for sensitive info!
- **No logging or moderation:** Everything is up to the server host.

## Tips for Safer Use
- Only use ChatMD with people you trust.
- Don't share personal or sensitive information.
- If you host a server, use a strong firewall and only share your IP/port with friends.
- For real privacy, use a VPN or encrypted tunnel (like SSH port forwarding).

## Disclaimer
This project is for fun and learning. **Do not use it for anything critical or secret!**
